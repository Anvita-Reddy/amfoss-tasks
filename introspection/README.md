## Introspection

### Why must we choose you?
One of the reasons I joined Amrita is because of the student clubs. I love taking part in social and community development activities. Being part of a prestigious club like amFOSS is a huge accomplishment to me. I will take every opportunity to learn and better myself. I would get a chance to grow as a person. This is the best way to meet people and share our views in an open-minded community. Participating in coding competitions is one of my goals. I love travelling, and I hope to attend various events across the world as a member of amFOSS. This will surely help in my career development as well.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I want to settle in quickly and adapt to the new environment. I hope to gain confidence from my seniors and peers that I am reliable and can be trusted with new tasks. I have a lot to learn, and I will utilize every resource available to me to improve my skillset.

### How would you contribute back to the club? 
I am determined, and I will stay committed to the club throughout. I will help my peers and learn along with them. I hope to prove myself that I am capable enough and help out in selecting new members eventually. I will do my best to be present at every event that amFOSS conducts.

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The selection process is well planned. Some of the tasks were challenging. Meetings were conducted every week, and we were required to update about our progress and share our thoughts during the meetings. Seniors were always present to help out.
